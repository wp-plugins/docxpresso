If you are used to write all your documents using a Office Suite 
Word Processor like the ones available in
MS Office, Libre Office or Open Office **Docxpresso** is the WordPress plugin

This plugin will allow you to publish content that has been generated with your
favourite Office Suite (MS, libre or Open Office) preserving all of its structure,
design and format:

* Nicely formatted text
* Headings
* Tables
* Links and bookmarks

* Images
* Textboxes
* Footnotes and endnotes
* Headers and Footers
* Tables of contents (TOCs)

Moreover you may also create your own forms or even export your **charts**.

This plugin is a spin-off of our [Docxpresso API](http://www.docxpresso.com "Generate dynamically all your documents online")
library designed to generate all kind of dynamical documents on your web server (PDF, Word, ODT, RTF) that is free for
non-commercial use.

= How to use it =

1. Create a standard document with the content that you want to insert in your Post or Page using your favourite Word Processor (MS Word, Libre Office or Open Office).
2. IMPORTANT: Save your document in **.odt** format. In MS Word choose OpenDocument (*.odt) in your **Save As** dialogue (in Libre or Open Office is the default format).
3. Create or edit a Post or Page in your WordPress interface.

6. After choosing a file click on the **Insert** button.
7. A [docxpresso] shortcode will be included within your text editor.     
8. You may then add or not any additional content to your post but do not try to modify by hand the contents of the Docxpresso shortcode unless you really know what you are doing.
9. You may insert as many documents as you wish in a single Post or Page.
